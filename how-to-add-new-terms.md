# How to add terms to this repository

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-status:wip-5319e7.svg)

In this tutorial, we will use VS Code but if you prefer, you can use any other editor or even command line tools.

1. Clone the repository.

2. Create your own branch.

3. Add whichever term(s) you think should be added to the `terms` folder:

   - Each term should be in a separate `<term>.md` file. Keep the filename lowercase.
   
   - Add the term as the first header in the file (`# <term>`)
   
   - In the first paragraph after the first header, add the explanation of the term.
   
   - (Optional) Add a section `## Readings` where you add a bulletpoint for each _reading_ you think is valuable to grasp the term that you want to add to the glossary.
   
   - (Optional) Add a section `## Tutorials` where you add a bulletpoint for each _tutorial_ you think is valuable to grasp the term that you want to add to the glossary.
   
   - (If you want a model file to look at, [here is one available](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/model.md).)
   
4. Add a pull request to the `v2.0` branch.
