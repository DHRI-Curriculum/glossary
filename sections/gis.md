# GIS

## Glossary  

Please see below a list of key terms and concepts, provided in alphabetical order, from Javier Otero Pe√±a's [Introduction to Mapping using QGIS workshop](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/mapping).

An *attribute* is a characteristic of a feature (see below). Attributes can contain data of different types: strings (text), numerical values, dates, or booleans. Each column in the Attribute Table represents a different attribute.

*Feature*: an entity that appears in a layer on a map

*Georeferencing*: the process of using geographic data to represent features on a GIS.

*Layers* organizes the data in QGIS. They can be imagined as transparent film sheets with different types of features drawn over them: 

*Raster*: images or maps with a specific resolution that determine how accurate the information is (as well as the file size). They are commonly used for continuous data, such as temperature and elevation.

*Vector*: a scalable point, line or polygon that can be easily created, edited, or deleted using QGIS. Does not have a specific resolution.
