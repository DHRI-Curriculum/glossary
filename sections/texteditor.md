# Text editorÂ 

A program for creating and editing plain text files. Unlike word processors such as LibreOffice and Word, which create complex documents in the form of archives that include formatting information and other metadata, a plain text editor creates a single file. Programmers tend to use plain text files because computers can work with them easily. Sublime Text, Nano, and VI are examples of text editors.
