# Jekyll

## Running Jekyll

These Jekyll-related commands can be entered in bash. (That's the prompt with the `$`.)

`jekyll new site_name` - This command will create a jekyll instance inside the directory you are currently in (use `cwd` to see what your current working directory is).

`bundle exec jekyll serve` - This command will start the jekyll server in the directory you are currently in (use `cwd` to see what your current working directory is). After it is running, go to http://localhost:4000 in your preferred web browser. _Note that you must first run `jekyll new` inside your directory._
