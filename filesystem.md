# Filesystem	

A filesystem (or file system) is a set of methods and data structures that an operating system (e.g., Windows, MacOS, Linux, etc.) uses to  control how data is stored and retrieved on a disk (such as your computer’s hard drive, or even a USB pen drive). Some operating systems include support for more than one file system.
