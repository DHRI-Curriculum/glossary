# Policing the crisis

Stuart Hall et al.'s concept of "policing the crisis" refers to the unnatural process by which certain actions (by certain people) become and continue to be understood, reported, policed, and sanctioned as a type of "crime." The police, the judicial system, and mainstream media "are actively and continuously part of [this] whole process" (source: Stuart Hall et al., Policing the Crisis, 2013 [1978], page 54.
