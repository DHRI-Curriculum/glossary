# Raster

images of a specific location that represent visually continuous data such as temperature and elevation at a given resolution. Higher resolutions mean more precision but also larger file size. Raster layers have no Attribute Table; the values are stored within the image and represented as different hues or colors. Raster images can also be used for reference or aesthetic purposes (e.g. satellite photos).
