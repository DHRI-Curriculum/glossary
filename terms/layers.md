# Layers

Layers are "containers" of the data in QGIS. On the map view, layers can be imagined as transparent film sheets that are laid one over another. With the exception of raster layers, each layer contains an Attribute Table, that is, a series of features that in turn have their own attributes. Vector layers can only contain one type of vectors, be it: points, lines or polygons.
