# list indexing

List indexing is a foundational tool for working with lists. It allows one to access items from a list by specifying the item according to its location within the list. The item location is represented the number within brackets. In a list index, the count starts at 0, so the first item is accessed by `list[0]` and the second item by `list[1]`, the third item by `list[2]`, and so on.
