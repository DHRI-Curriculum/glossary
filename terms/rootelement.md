# Root Element

The root element is used in HTML to denote the outermost element that organizes all the content of an HTML document. For example, in the code below, `<html lang="en">` denotes the opening tag of the root element and `</html>` denotes the closing tag of the root element. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

  <head>
      ...
  </head>

  <body>
      ...
  </body>

</html>
```
