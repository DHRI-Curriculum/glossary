# Data

There are many different perspectives towards what counts as data. Some cites data as "material or information" for which "an argument, theory, test or hypothesis, or another research output is based" upon ([Queensland University of Technology](http://www.mopp.qut.edu.au/D/D_02_08.jsp)), while others critiques the understanding of data as "mere descriptions ofa priori conditions" ([Johanna Drucker](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html)). Data, in our case, are subjective (because of our interests and assumptions) and are materials and/or information necessary to come to our conclusion.
