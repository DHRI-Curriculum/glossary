# Git

Git is software used for version controlâ€”that is, tracking the state of files and changes you make to them over time. Git can be enabled in a folder, and then used to save the state of the contents in that folder at different points in the future, as designated by you.

Git is also useful for collaboration, as a repository can be shared across computers, and its contents can be asynchonously developed and eventually merged with the main project. 

In this workshop, you'll use Git on your local machines to track changes you make to a file.
