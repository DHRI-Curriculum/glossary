# len()

`len()` is a function that calculates the length of the object within the parenthesis. For a string, it will count the number of characters: `len("hello")` will return `5`, and `len("hi there")` will return `8`, because it counts blank spaces. For a list, `len()` will count the number of list items: 

```pycon
>>> groceries = ["berries", "bananas", "oat milk", "eggs", "spinach", "bell peppers", "ice cream", "frozen pizza", "floss", "hand soap"]
>>> len(groceries)
10
```
