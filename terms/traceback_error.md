# Traceback Errors

Along with syntax errors, traceback errors are a common type of error in Python code. It appears during the execution of the code, when Python is unable to continue, meaning that there is a problem with the flow of your program. Often, traceback errors point to undefined variables or functions.

When a traceback error occurs, the interpreter will give you a little more information about the error. If it's a name error, that means that something is not defined properly. If it's a type error, that means that an operation or function is of the wrong type. Take a close look at the display message to get more information about your error, and help you with debugging.
