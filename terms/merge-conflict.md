# Merge conflict

If, when attempting to merge, there is a line that has been changed by both parties, you will experience a merge conflict. This means that Git needs your manual intervention to decide which of the two changes will be the canonical or accepted change. A merge conflict is resolved by editing the conflicting files with a text editor, then adding and committing to resolve the merge.
