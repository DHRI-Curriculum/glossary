# Big data

"Big data" generally refers to digital projects that deal with very large datasets from which different kinds of patterns or analyses are computed. Oftentimes big data researchers do not obtain the informed consent of each person represented by or linked to the obtained data. This can be an ethical concern, given that "even seemingly innocuous and anonymized data have produced unanticipated ethical questions and detrimental impacts" (source: [Matthew Zook, et al. 2017](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005399)).
