# Category

A category is "a term (meaning literally ‘predication’ or ‘assertion’) given to certain general classes of terms, things, or notions" (source: Oxford English Dictionary online). The construction and reproduction of categories—through e.g. library subject headings, tags on websites, categorization methods informing algorithms, and spatial divisions on a map—are an important ethical consideration when doing digital research or a digital project.
