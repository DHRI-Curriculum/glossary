# CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is usually used in conjunction with HTML. HTML tells the browser what the different parts of a document _are_. CSS tells the browser what the parts of the document should _look like_. It is essentially a set of rules that are applied when rendering an HTML document. Its name—Cascading Style Sheets—refers to the fact that there is an order of precedence in how the browswer applies CSS rules to a text.
