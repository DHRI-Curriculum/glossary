# Vector

A scalable point, line or polygon that can be easily created, edited, or deleted using GIS. Does not have a specific resolution. In QGIS, vectors are contained in vector layers, that can only contain a single type of vectors. Each vector represents a single feature, although some features may be represented by more than one vector (e.g. the vector of the United States includes the mainland U.S. polygon but also polygons for Alaska and Hawaii).
