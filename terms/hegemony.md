# Hegemony

Antonio Gramsci's concept of hegemony refers to “the ability of a dominant group to create [majority] consent and agreement [around a particular system of meanings] within a population without the use or threat of force” (source: Kenneth Guest, *Cultural Anthropology: A Toolkit for a Global Age*, 2014, page 52). Hegemony is one way of understanding how dominant forms of knowledge and power produce and reinforce each other.
