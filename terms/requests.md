# requests

The requests module or requests library allows users to make requests to web pages. It is a useful tool for web scraping, and though it's relatively easy to get started, the learning curve can be steep. 

To use requests, import the module into your script, then set up a response object. In the parenthesis, include the URL of the webpage you want to scrape, enclosed by single quotes.

```pycon
import requests
x = requests.get('<websiteURL>')
```
