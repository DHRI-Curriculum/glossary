# Root

The root is the top-level directory of a [filesystem](filesystem.md). Staying with the tree metaphor to represent a hierarchical structure, if the root is the starting point, the folders are the tree’s branches, and thee files are the leaves. Please note that “root” is also often used as a synonym for the administrative user on a system.
