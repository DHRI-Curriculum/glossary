# Polygon

a figure with three or more sides. In GIS, it usually refers to complex areas outlining lakes, city blocks, a set of buildings, or other complex features of the map, that can be outlined using interconnected points. A polygon can have an unlimited amount of points. The more points (or "higher the resolution"), the smoother the polygon will look to the human eye.
