# Remote

*remote* - An adjective describing a computer that is somewhere else. A "remote machine" is a machine you do not have physical access to, but might have access through a means such as the internet. In Git, a remote is a repository that is not on your computer, but is connected to your local repository. You can add new remotes with the `git remote add` command, and change them with the `gitremote set-url` command.
