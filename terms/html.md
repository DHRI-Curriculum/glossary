# HTML

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to write web-based documents. It enables us to provide web browsers with information about the _content_ of a document. We can, for example, indicate that some part of our document is a paragraph, image, heading, or link. The browser uses this information when displaying the document for users.
