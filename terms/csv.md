# CSV (file format)

CSV or Comma Separated Values uses---you guessed it!---commas to separate values. Each line (First Name, Last Name) is a new "record" and each column (separated by a comma) is a new "field." This data format stores tabular data in a clean way that facilitates the transfer between different data architectures. As data types go, it is very rudimentary (even predating computers!) and is easy to type, without needing special characters beyond a comma.

```
First Name,Last Name
Smally,McTiny
Kitty,Kitty
Foots,Smith
Tiger,Jaws
