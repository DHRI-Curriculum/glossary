# JSON (file format)

JSON or JavaScript Object Notation, also uses a nesting structure, but with the addition of "key/value" pairs, like the firstName key which is tied to the `Smally` value (at least for the first cat!). JSON is popular with web applications that save and send data from your browser to web servers, because it uses the main language of web browsers, JavaScript, to work with data.

```json
{
    "Cats": [ 
        {
            "firstName": "Smally",
            "lastName": "McTiny"
        }, 
        {
            "firstName": "Kitty",
            "lastName": "Kitty"
        },
        {
            "firstName": "Foots",
            "lastName":"Smith"
        }, 
        {
            "firstName": "Tiger",
            "lastName":"Jaws"
        } 
    ]
} 
```
