# Lemmatization

A process of collapsing words in an attempt to reduce the number of words, and get a realistic understanding of the meaning of a text. Lemmatization references the word and finds the appropriate root and can therefore take longer than other processes of collapsing words. See "stemming" in this glossary for another process of collapsing words in a corpus.
