### Variables

A variable is a name that is assigned to a value. Assignment looks like this:

```python
x = 3
name = "Patrick"
name2 = "Ignatz"
grocery_list = ["tomato", "limes", "chocolate"]
```

Variable assignment uses a single `=`. The name given is on the left of the `=`, the value is on the right of the `=`.
