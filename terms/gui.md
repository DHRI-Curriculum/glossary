# GUI 

"Graphical User Interface,” pronounced "gooey.” It’s a system of interactive visual components for computer software… basically, anything on a computer that isn't in the command line. All familiar elements of day-to-day computer tasks such as images, windows, prompts, buttons, and progress bars are part of the GUI. The way most people interact with computers. Some tasks can only be done in a GUI, while others can only be done in the command line.
