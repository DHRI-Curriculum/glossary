# Personhood

Personhood is "the quality or condition of being a person; [especially] personal identity, selfhood" (Oxford English Dictionary online). When doing internet or digital research, it is important to consider how a person's data, avatar, images, videos, audio files, social media and other forms of digital information may be understood as an expression of their personhood (source: [the AoIR Ethics Working Committee's 2012 report](http://aoir.org/reports/ethics2.pdf).
