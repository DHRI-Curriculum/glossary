# Attributes

Attributes offer secondary information about an element in HTML. Each attribute is nestled within the element tag. For example, the HTML command `<a href="https://www.dhinstitutes.org/">Digital Humanities Research Institute</a>` contains a link to the Digital Humanities Research Institute website. Here, the `a` element denotes a hyperlink and the `href` denote an attribute that specifies the hyperlink's destination.
