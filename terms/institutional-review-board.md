# Institutional Review Board (IRB)

An institutional body (a designated group of people) that is intended to provide oversight, administrative support, and educational training to ensure that research with human subjects done by researchers of that institution complies with federal and state regulations, and university or institutional policy. Every university or research institution must, legally, have its own or an affiliated IRB.
