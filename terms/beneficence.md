# Beneficence

Beneficence is a core principe in *the Belmont Report* that stipulates that researchers should "(1) do not harm and (2) maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms." A key concern when applying this principle is an *assessment of risks and benefits* (source: [The Belmont Report](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html#xbasic).
