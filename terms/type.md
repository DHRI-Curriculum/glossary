# type()

**Python**

`type()` is a function that evaluates the data type of the object within the parenthesis. For a string `"hello world"`, it will return: `<str>`; for an integer `5`, it will return `<int>` and so on.

**Text analysis**

In our text analysis workshop, `type` means unique vocabulary items in a corpus. (Ex: "Whale" and "whale" are different *types*.)
