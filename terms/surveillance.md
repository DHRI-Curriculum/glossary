# Surveillance

Surveillance refers to "the watch or guard kept over a person, etc., [especially] over a suspected person, a prisoner, or the like; often, spying, supervision" or "supervision for the purpose of direction or control" (source: Oxford English Dictionary online). Surveillance, per my understanding, includes research (including *"big data"* research) of people's personal digital data that is conducted without their informed consent, as well as businesses' or governments' uses of various programs and devices to record or listen to people's behaviors, data, voices etc.
