# Stemming

A process of collapsing words in an attempt to reduce the number of words, and get a realistic understanding of the meaning of a text. Stemming cuts off affixes to find the root (or the stem) of the word. See "lemmatization" in this glossary for another process of collapsing words in a corpus.
