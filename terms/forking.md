# Forking

Forking is a proper function of the GitHub platform. It supports collaboration by allowing you to copy someone else's repository to your own account on GitHub while maintaining a trail of attribution and derivation. 

Once the files are forks, you can clone or download them, edit them, and share your changes on GitHub. Git and GitHub help track and be transparent about contributions or attribution.
