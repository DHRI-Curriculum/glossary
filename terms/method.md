# Method

A method in Python is similar to a function, in that it allows us to do things with data. However, a method is attached to what we call an *object*, which is a representation of data. Accordingly, a method operates as a function that is specifically available for that object. 

Methods are accessed through the dot syntax `.`.  For example, the method `lower()` can be attached to a string object like so: `"HELLO".lower()` and will return the string `'hello'`.
