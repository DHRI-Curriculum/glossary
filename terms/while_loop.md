# while loops

Like for loops, while loops are a way of going through items in a list. The difference is that while loops will continue to execute as long as a certain condition is true. To get out of the loop, use the break command, or type `control-c` or `quit()` in the interpreter. Otherwise, the loop will keep going.

```python
while True:
    print("Oh no! I'm stuck...")
```
